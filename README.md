PhishNet-Combatant is a phishing email detector which deploys machine learning algorithms to detect phishing emails. This was created for TAMUHack X. 

## Running the website locally 
In order to run the website locally, NodeJS is required. Install this here: [Download](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiouaS-zoCEAxWCrmoFHcd8DXsQjBB6BAgJEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnodejs.org%2Fen%2Fdownload%2Fcurrent&usg=AOvVaw3cdHQ1YR97tDpan9W3w1HN&opi=89978449)

Clone the repository and open the directory in a terminal. Then, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then run the React server:
```
npm run dev
```

Finally, open the server IP in a browser.

NOTE: The website is *STILL* a work in progress. Meaning, the email checking functionality *for the website* does not work yet. In order to have an email checked for phishing, simply forward the email to PhishNet-Combatant at phishnetcombatant@gmail.com, and wait for a reply.
